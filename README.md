# Arduino-Projects
Some random Arduino Projects that were created in the past four years. 

PNEUMATIC STATE MACHINE: 
Was given a complicated hydraulic system controlled by an arduino. The system was used to move a ball around in a circuit, and using different sensors we were tasked to keep the ball moving without a delay. Used two different methods, one using milliseconds to time the balls circuit, and one using a state machine with trigger conditions to move the balls. Eventually we were tasked with moving two balls around the cicuit (See Mechatronics Project). 

TONE MELODY:
Just a simple program to play with the speakers of the Arduino. Used mostly to test the Arduino's condition. 

NEILVOICEBOX:
Using an Arduino and a VoiceSheild (see link below), I was able to construct a little box that would play recorded voice clips at the push of a button. Created a box that had 16 seperate buttons with different voicelines. Used to help someone who had lost use of their voice.
